Create a package named my package with two modules module1 and module2. 
In module1, define a function add(a, b) that returns the sum of two numbers. 
In module2, define a function subtract(a, b) that returns the difference of two numbers. 
Write a script to use both functions from the package.


3

 Write a program to create a module name my_functions and perform 
 string manipulation function for counting the vowels and reversing the string 


4
Create a Module  named calculator and do all the operations 
add, mul, sub, div and use that module to create a calculator operation in another python file.


5
Write a function called fibonacci(n) that takes a non-negative integer n as input.
The function should calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

6
Create a Python package named date_utils with an __init__.py file.
Inside the package, create a module named calculations.py.
Define functions in the calculations.py module to perform basic date calculations, such as:
days_between(date1, date2) - This function takes two date objects as input and returns the number of days between them.
add_days(date, days) - This function takes a date object and an integer (number of days) as input and returns a new date object with the specified number of days added.
Write a separate Python script that imports the date_utils.calculations module and uses the defined functions to perform date calculations.

Write a program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 100.
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
Otherwise, print the number itself.

8


Given a list of consecutive numbers (except for one missing number), write a program that finds the missing number

9

 Find the first non-repeating character in a given string.
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
